# Texts Sentiment Analysis


## Overview

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

This is the fourth Project of Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program from Udacity, aiming to create a web tool to evaluate News with NLP, which allows user to submit a URL of an article and receive a sentiment analysis result of the article back.
